      My name is Ali Chowdhury and I am an aspiring software engineer who is committed to leveraging my technical expertise to make a positive impact in the industry. With a professional demeanor and a keen eye for detail, I am focused on using my skills to expand my personal network and advance my career in the field of computer science.<br><br>
      As a bilingual individual who is certified in HTML, CSS, and Test Out Network Pro, I possess the communication and collaboration skills necessary to work effectively with individuals from diverse backgrounds. My professional experience as an audio-visual IT co-op at Emerson and a retail associate at The UPS Store has honed my time management and problem-solving abilities, preparing me to succeed in high-pressure situations.<br><br>
      
      Currently, I am a senior pursuing a degree in computer science at Wayne State University, where I have consistently maintained a 4.0 GPA and earned a place on the College of Engineering's Dean's list for two consecutive semesters. I am on track to graduate in December 2023.
      
      In addition to my academic pursuits, I have participated in several volunteer and course work projects that showcase my technical proficiency, including designing and programming an RPG game, creating a calorie counting Discord bot, and developing a resource that utilizes the Selenium API to extract NBA player statistics and output them into a spreadsheet. I have also volunteered as a notary, spindled runner tags for the Susan G Komen race, and mentored freshmen students at SHHS to help them achieve passing grades.<br><br>

      Overall, I am passionate about utilizing my technical skills to make a meaningful impact in the computer science industry. I look forward to exploring new opportunities and expanding my expertise in the field.

      Jared Endicott is a hard-working college student, and aspiring software developer, currently attending Wayne State University studying computer science as a member of the Wayne state Honors College.<br> He has been working with code since he was 13 years old when he gained an intrest in programming trying to learn how video games were made, and how he could develop mods for them.<br><br>Outside of work He can generally be found
      either at his desk playing games with friends or working on personal projects, or if the Michigan weather decides to play nice, he can be found jammed under one of his many cars that never seem to stay in running shape.<br><br>He is always looking to learn something new, especially when it comes to programming, and one day hopes to be able to get his dream job as an automotive powertrain embedded C software developer.

      My name is Ian Siple, and I am an aspiring software engineer. I've been programming since I was about 12 years old when I joined my local high school robotics team. Currently, outside of school, I still help out my high school robotics team as a mentor. I also currently work for Optum as a software testing engineer. Outside work and school, I like to get outside and play any sort of sport. I am hoping to start traveling more in the coming years as well! I am still unsure of what I want to do with my degree and what industry I want to get into. I plan to move from job to job to experience different aspects of computer science and find what I'm interested in.
