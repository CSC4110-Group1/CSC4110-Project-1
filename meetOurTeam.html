      My name is Ali Chowdhury and I am an aspiring software engineer who is committed to leveraging my technical expertise to make a positive impact in the industry. With a professional demeanor and a keen eye for detail, I am focused on using my skills to expand my personal network and advance my career in the field of computer science.<br><br>
      As a bilingual individual who is certified in HTML, CSS, and Test Out Network Pro, I possess the communication and collaboration skills necessary to work effectively with individuals from diverse backgrounds. My professional experience as an audio-visual IT co-op at Emerson and a retail associate at The UPS Store has honed my time management and problem-solving abilities, preparing me to succeed in high-pressure situations.<br><br>
      
      Currently, I am a senior pursuing a degree in computer science at Wayne State University, where I have consistently maintained a 4.0 GPA and earned a place on the College of Engineering's Dean's list for two consecutive semesters. I am on track to graduate in December 2023.
      
      In addition to my academic pursuits, I have participated in several volunteer and course work projects that showcase my technical proficiency, including designing and programming an RPG game, creating a calorie counting Discord bot, and developing a resource that utilizes the Selenium API to extract NBA player statistics and output them into a spreadsheet. I have also volunteered as a notary, spindled runner tags for the Susan G Komen race, and mentored freshmen students at SHHS to help them achieve passing grades.<br><br>

      Overall, I am passionate about utilizing my technical skills to make a meaningful impact in the computer science industry. I look forward to exploring new opportunities and expanding my expertise in the field.
